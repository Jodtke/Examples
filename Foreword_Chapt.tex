\bchapter{Foreword}
\label{chap:foreword}

The OpenMP Examples document has been updated with new features
found in the OpenMP 5.1 Specification. The additional examples and updates
are referenced in the Document Revision History of the Appendix on page~\pageref{chap:history}.

Text describing an example with a 5.1 feature specifically states
that the feature support begins in the OpenMP 5.1 Specification.  Also,
an \code{\small omp\_5.1} keyword is included in the  metadata of the source code.
These distinctions are presented to remind readers that a 5.1 compliant 
OpenMP implementation is necessary to use these features in codes.

Examples for most of the 5.1 features are included in this document,
and incremental releases will become available as more feature examples
and updates are submitted, and approved by the OpenMP Examples Subcommittee.
