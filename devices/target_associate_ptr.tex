\section{Device and Host Memory Association}
\label{sec:target_associate_ptr}

The association of device memory with host memory
can be established by calling the \scode{omp_target_associate_ptr} 
API routine as part of the mapping.
The following example shows the use of this routine
to associate device memory of size \splc{CS}, 
allocated by the \scode{omp_target_alloc} routine and
pointed to by the device pointer \splc{dev_ptr}, 
with a chunk of the host array \splc{arr} starting at index \splc{ioff}.
In Fortran, the intrinsic function \scode{c_loc} is called
to obtain the corresponding C pointer (\splc{h_ptr}) of \splc{arr(ioff)} 
for use in the call to the API routine.

Since the reference count of the resulting mapping is infinite,
it is necessary to use the \scode{target}~\scode{update} directive (or
the \scode{always} modifier in a \scode{map} clause) to accomplish a
data transfer between host and device.
The explicit mapping of the array section \splc{arr[ioff:CS]} 
(or \splc{arr(ioff:ioff+CS-1)} in Fortran) on the \scode{target}
construct ensures that the allocated and associated device memory is used 
when referencing the array \splc{arr} in the \scode{target} region.
The device pointer \splc{dev_ptr} cannot be accessed directly 
after a call to the \scode{omp_target_associate_ptr} routine.

After the \scode{target} region, the device pointer is disassociated from
the current chunk of the host memory by calling the \scode{omp_target_disassociate_ptr} routine before working on the next chunk.
The device memory is freed by calling the \scode{omp_target_free}
routine at the end.
